# BestIcecream

Welcome to BestIcecream gem! I created this gem to find the best ice cream in your city or around the world. There's a lot of great options for ice cream, some I've been too and others I look forward to checking out!

I hope you are looking forward to finding the best ice cream no matter where you are! Yummy!!!


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'best_icecream'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install best_icecream

## Usage

To use this gem follow the installation instructions above. The original code is a base for parsing the data from any website that lists ice cream parlors. Feel free to edit according to your needs.

To run the CLI, type in ./bin/best-icecream, which will give you an initial list of ice cream parlors. Type a number for more information, including the name, address, phone number and website for each ice cream parlor.

When you are finished reviewing the list, type exit to exit the CLI.

Here's a quick video demo:

I hope you got some good ideas for ice cream parlors to check out! :)


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
